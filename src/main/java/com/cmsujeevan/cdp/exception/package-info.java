/**
 * This package contains exception and validation classes for handling errors and json node validation.
 * <p>
 * Exception classes in this package represent various types of exceptions that may occur
 * during the execution of the application, such as json node validation errors, business rule violations,
 * and system failures. These classes provide custom error messages and information to help
 * diagnose and troubleshoot issues.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Validation classes in this package define custom validation rules and constraints that can be
 * applied to domain objects or DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to ensure data integrity and
 * consistency. These classes typically use annotations provided by frameworks like Hibernate
 * Validator to define validation rules for specific json fields or object properties.
