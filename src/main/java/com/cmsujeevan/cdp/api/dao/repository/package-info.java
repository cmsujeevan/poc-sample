/**
 * This package contains repository interfaces for accessing data from the database.
 * <p>
 * Repository interfaces in this package define methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read,
 * Update, Delete) operations on domain objects. These interfaces typically extend
 * Spring Data JPA's JpaRepository or EntityManager.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Repository interfaces provide a higher-level abstraction for data access, allowing
 * the application to interact with the underlying database without dealing directly
 * with SQL queries and JDBC operations.
