/**
 * This package contains constant classes for defining application-wide constants.
 * <p>
 * Constant classes in this package define static final fields to represent
 * various constants such as configuration properties, error codes, S3 keys,
 * and application-specific constants.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Constant classes help to centralize the definition of constants and provide
 * a standardized way of accessing and managing them throughout the application.
